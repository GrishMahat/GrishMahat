# **Hi 👋 I'm Grish**

### **Systems-minded developer who cares about how things actually work**

I build things from the inside out. I like digging into system behavior, understanding internals, and making software faster and cleaner.
If performance matters, I’m interested.
If it involves ten layers of YAML summoning circles, I mysteriously vanish.

## **What I’m into**

* System-level problems
* Performance and low-level behavior
* How runtimes, kernels, and tools actually work
* Solving bugs that shouldn’t exist, but somehow do

---

## **Tech I actually use**

### **Core**

* **Rust** when I don’t feel like apologizing to the CPU
* **Go** when I want concurrency without philosophical trauma
* **TypeScript / JavaScript (Bun)** when speed of development beats purity

### **Familiar**

* Python, Node, Linux tooling
* Mobile stuff when the universe forces it

---

## **How I think about engineering**

Good code is predictable.
Magic belongs in card tricks, not in frameworks hiding a hundred things “for convenience.”
If I can’t understand what the machine is actually doing, I don’t trust the result.

---

## **What I’m improving right now**

* Writing cleaner, lower-level Rust
* Understanding system internals deeply enough to break fewer things
* Building tools that don’t trade speed for convenience
