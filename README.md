# Hey, I'm Grish 👋

Started in 2022. Couldn't stop. Still haven't.

Got into programming because I wanted to make a game. Never made the game. Accidentally learned how computers work instead. Honestly a fair trade.

From there I just kept going deeper 
That rabbit hole led me to systems programming, low-level behavior, and eventually Rust, which I fell in love with for exactly the reason people say it's painful: it forces you to think.

Then a few months ago, Java clicked. And I mean *clicked*. After spending time thinking about memory and ownership and what the machine is doing, Java's verbosity stopped feeling like noise and started feeling like honesty. Every layer tells you what it's doing. Nothing hides. I respect that.

## What I actually care about

- Understanding what's happening one level below where most people look
- Performance — not as an obsession, but as a standard
- Code that's predictable, not clever
- Tooling that respects your time

---

## Tech I use

**Reach for first:**
Rust · Java · Go · TypeScript (Bun)

**Comfortable with:**
Python · Node · Linux tooling



## Right now

- Getting deeper into the Java ecosystem and actually enjoying it
- Writing Rust that I'm not embarrassed by
- Learning system internals well enough to break fewer things

*4 years in. Still the most interesting thing I've found.*
